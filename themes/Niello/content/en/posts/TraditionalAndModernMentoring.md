How exactly do you approach mentoring someone, or what model fits your work environment best? In this article, I will discuss the traditional and modern mentoring models along with the basics of mentoring, common challenges, and some best practices. The goal is to provide some light on mentoring and various models that exist to help get the job done.
It's important to remember that for mentoring to be successful, it has to work for both the mentee and mentor. Sometimes everyone needs something a little bit different, and hopefully this will give you some ideas on how to approach your next mentoring opportunity.

## What is Mentoring?

Mentoring is learning through the experience of others within a given context. Being a mentor can be a
challenging and rewarding experience. Every mentee's needs are different so its important to discuss and
come up with goals the mentor and mentee want to achieve during the process. Revisiting these goals
periodically will also help everything keep on track and make sure the mentee is getting what they need out of
the partnership. To help work with a mentee, here are some best practices to follow:

1. **Be the person you wish you had when you started**
   - Remember what you were missing as a new employee? Provide those things for your mentee. You were in their position once, use that understanding to guide them.

2. **Active Listening**
   - Ask then listen. Active listening is one of the most important skill of being a mentor. Most of the time when someone needs help, all they really need is to discuss the problem they are facing. A lot of the time the Mentee will be able to figure out the answers they are looking for just by talking it out. Other times, they may not be asking for what they really need. By using active listening skills, a mentor should be able to identify these situations and provide the help the mentee really needs.

3. **Resourcefulness**

    - It's ok not to have all the answers your mentee needs. What's important is to show your mentee your process on what you do when you need help or need to find an answer. This will help your mentee to become more self sufficient and productive in their new role.

### Common Challenges

Even with these guidelines, there are still common challenges that will arise. Below is a list of common challenges a mentor or mentee may encounter.

| Common Challenges         | Description                                                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recognize need for help   | Mentees can be afraid or not sure how to ask for help when they need it. |
| Allow for trial and error | Its ok to let the mentee fail before providing the correct answer.       |
