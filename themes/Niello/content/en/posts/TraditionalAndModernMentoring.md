Ever wondered how to actually mentor someone effectively? Or maybe you're trying to figure out what mentoring approach would work best in your workplace? <br>
As you move up the corproate ladder in your career, its often expected that you begin to mentor and teach more juior employees. In fact, almost every job posting out there include the ability to Mentor and teach neccessay skills. I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and there's honestly no one-size-fits-all answer. That's why I want to walk you through both the tried-and-true mentoring methods and some of the newer approaches that are gaining traction. We'll also dive into the fundamentals, tackle some of those tricky challenges you're bound to face, and share some practical tips that actually work.
Here's the thing though – and this is super important – mentoring only works when it clicks for both people involved. What works perfectly for one mentor-mentee pair might fall flat for another. Everyone brings different needs, communication styles, and goals to the table.
So whether you're about to mentor someone for the first time or you're looking to shake up your current approach, I'm hoping this gives you some fresh ideas and maybe a few "aha" moments for your next mentoring relationship.

## What is Mentoring?

Mentoring is learning through the experience of others within a given context. Being a mentor can be a
challenging and rewarding experience. Every mentee's needs are different so its important to discuss and
come up with goals the mentor and mentee want to achieve during the process. Revisiting these goals
periodically will also help everything keep on track and make sure the mentee is getting what they need out of
the partnership. To help work with a mentee, here are some best practices to follow:

1. **Be the person you wish you had when you started**
   - Remember what you were missing as a new employee? Provide those things for your mentee. You were in their position once, use that understanding to guide them.

2. **Active Listening**
   - Ask then listen. Active listening is one of the most important skill of being a mentor. Most of the time when someone needs help, all they really need is to discuss the problem they are facing. A lot of the time the Mentee will be able to figure out the answers they are looking for just by talking it out. Other times, they may not be asking for what they really need. By using active listening skills, a mentor should be able to identify these situations and provide the help the mentee really needs.

3. **Resourcefulness**

    - It's ok not to have all the answers your mentee needs. What's important is to show your mentee your process on what you do when you need help or need to find an answer. This will help your mentee to become more self sufficient and productive in their new role.

### Common Challenges

Even with these guidelines, there are still common challenges that will arise. Below is a list of common challenges a mentor or mentee may encounter.
