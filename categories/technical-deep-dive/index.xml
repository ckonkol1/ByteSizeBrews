&lt;p>As a software engineer, there are countless tools available to boost productivity and make development life easier. As an experienced developer, I wanted to share the tools I use daily and explain why they&amp;rsquo;ve earned a permanent spot in my workflow. Keep in mind that tool choice is highly personal. What works for my coding style and needs might differ from yours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note: No affiliate links or sponsorships hereâ€”just sharing tools that actually make my coding life better. All links go straight to the official product sites.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Minimal vs. Controller-Based APIs</title><link>https://bytesizebrews.com/en/posts/techdeepdive/minimalvsfullapi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 13:30:10 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bytesizebrews.com/en/posts/techdeepdive/minimalvsfullapi/</guid><description>&lt;p>When it comes to building APIs in ASP.NET Core, developers often find themselves weighing the benefits of
&lt;span style="color: #0074D9; font-weight: bold;">Minimal APIs&lt;/span> against the more traditional &lt;span style="color: #12a14eff; font-weight: bold;">Controller-based APIs&lt;/span>.
Both approaches offer unique advantages and challenges, making it vital to choose the right one for your project. This guide provides a concise comparison of each method, highlighting their pros and cons to help you make an informed architectural decision.&lt;/p>
