&lt;p>How exactly do you approach mentoring someone, or what model fits your work environment best? In this article, I will discuss the traditional and modern mentoring models along with the basics of mentoring, common challenges, and some best practices. The goal is to provide some light on mentoring and various models that exist to help get the job done.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that for mentoring to be successful, it has to work for both the mentee and mentor. Sometimes everyone needs something a little bit different, and hopefully this will give you some ideas on how to approach your next mentoring opportunity.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
